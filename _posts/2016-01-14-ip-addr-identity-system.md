Lately, I've been scambaiters messing with scammers like [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5I13A_Hfbo), and I have pretty much been _inspired_ to write about some of the absurd things the scammers say to make themselves sound intelligent.
Specifically, in this video, the scammer who seems to have been promoted to the "Anti-Hacking team" over the course of 1 minute, talks about how an "IP" is the "Identity part of your machine," whatever that's supposed to mean.
Although IP does stand for Internet Protocol, to say that this is the "identity part" of a computer is quite misleading.

## How networking works
The Internet is made up of millions of computers connected together in different levels.
These levels are usually connected using routers, which are responsible for sending messages both between machines on the same network, and also between what are called subnets (sub-networks).
Since explaining this requires a lot of jargon and confusing stuff, I'll try to explain it with an analogy of snail mail.
