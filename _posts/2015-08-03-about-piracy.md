title: About Piracy

Ever since I became interested in computers and other electronic devices, I always wanted to do more with them, sometimes beyond what the manufacturer intended.
On every phone I dealt with predating the iPhone, I was always annoyed at the lack of useful apps on them, and the fact that it was extremely difficult, and sometimes impossible, to install more, whether it is to do with methods of installation (WAP only on older, lower-end phones), or to do with the fact that most of them were locked down.
Even when I got my first iPod (a nano 4G), I wished it had WiFi, and some proper apps instead of the limited selection of iPod games offered by Apple (not to be confused by the iPhone App Store).
